# K_MEANS_CLUSTERING  

### NOTES  
Got two algorithms for k-means-clustering  
One is with no use of sklearn, and is made from scratch  

The other, which is recommended, uses sklearn.  

The point is to decide how many clusters/group you want to seperate your data into, then it seperates them into k clusters.   
Then, the prediction is made by deciding to what cluster is the prediction feature the closest, and then makes prediction.
